# legend_of_di
A terminal based card game inspired by Legend of the 5 Rings. A companion 2D visualization application is provided.

I will translate the readme soon enough. To compile just run make. To use the companion application, build it using cmake, enable GUI_SUPPORT
while making the main game and then start.
